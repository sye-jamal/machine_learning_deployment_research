# Pile Bearing Capacity Prediction 🌍🔍  

## Overview  
This repository contains the deployment of machine learning models for predicting pile bearing capacity using Pile Load Test data. The goal is to provide a practical tool for:  
- Preliminary evaluation of pile bearing capacity before conducting actual pile load tests
- Small projects where pile load tests may be cost-prohibitive

## 🚀 Features  
- ML-based predictions using trained models  
- Web application interface for user-friendly input and output  
- Efficient & cost-effective alternative to traditional pile load testing  

## 🔬 Research Background  
This project is based on my research on machine learning in geotechnical engineering, specifically using pile load test data to enhance prediction accuracy and support decision-making in foundation design.
